		<h1>Welcome to the ThumbNailer project page</h1>
		<p>ThumbNailer uses <a href="http://gd2.rubyforge.org/">Ruby/GD2</a> to scales the given 
		image to fit within a box of the required size with either a transparent background or 
		one specified by the user. Should the source image be a JPEG with the image orientation 
		set in the EXIF data then the thumbnail will be rotated to the correct orientation.</p>
		<p>The return value is the thumbnail data in png format. Both the background / transparancy 
		colour and the output type can be changed.</p>
		<p>Performance is sufficient that this can be used to generate thumbnails on the fly.</p>
		<h2>Example using the defaults:</h2>
<pre>
f = File.new('happytree_t.png', 'w')
f.puts ThumbNailer.box_with_transparancy('happytree.jpg', 125)
f.close
</pre>
		<h2>Example changing the defaults:</h2>
<pre>
ThumbNailer.colours(1.0, 0.5, 0.1)
ThumbNailer.output_gif

f = File.new('happytree_t.gif', 'w')
f.puts ThumbNailer.box_with_background('happytree.jpg', 125)
f.close
</pre>
		<p>The colours used for the background or transparancy can be set on a per call basis:</p>
<pre>
f = File.new('happytree_t.gif', 'w')
f.puts ThumbNailer.box_with_background('happytree.jpg', 125, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7)
f.close
</pre>
		<h2>The transparancy colour</h2>
		<p>Whatever colour is used for transparancy there is always a chance that
		it is used in a picture and that the resulting thumbnail will look like
		Swiss Cheese. The alternative is to use the box_calc_transparancy method
		which will search the image for an unused colour to use for the transparancy
		colour. As this is extra work over and above that done by box_with_transparancy
		the method is a little slower. However the search is conducted over the scaled
		image and not the original source so if your thumbnails are small (125 pixels
		or less) then you can still use this method on the fly.</p>
		<h2>Useful stuff</h2>
		<p>A few extra function that I have found useful have been added to the 
		package just so everything is in one place.</p>
<pre>
f = File.new('happytree_t.gif', 'w')
f.puts ThumbNailer.max_width('happytree.jpg', 125)
f.close
</pre>
		<p>This will scale the image so that it is no wider than size whilest
		maintaining the aspect ratio. There is also max_height to scale the
		image so that it is no taller than size and max_either to scale the 
		image if either width or height is larger than size.</p>
